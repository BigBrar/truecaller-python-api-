Truecallerpy Phone Number Lookup - 

This is a simple Python script that demonstrates how to use the Truecallerpy library to perform phone number lookups. The script imports the search_phonenumber function from the truecallerpy library and uses it to search for information about a phone number.


To use this script, you will need to create an account with Truecallerpy and obtain an authentication ID. Please visit the official Truecallerpy documentation for instructions on how to create an account and obtain an authentication ID.


Once you have obtained an authentication ID, you can replace the empty string on line 5 with your authentication ID. Then, you can replace the phone number on line 8 with the phone number that you want to search for.


When you run the script, it will call the search_phonenumber function and pass in the phone number, country code, and authentication ID. The function will return a response containing the data associated with the phone number. The script extracts the data from the response, which includes the name of the person associated with the phone number and the carrier information of the phone number.


Please note that the script is just a sample code, you can make changes to it as per your requirement and use it to integrate the functionality of Truecaller in your projects.
